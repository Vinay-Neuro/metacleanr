\title{Convert median + IQR to mean and sd (conservative approximation)}
\usage{
median_to_mean_wanish(median, q1, q3)
}
\arguments{
\item{median}{numeric vector}

\item{q1}{numeric vector (first quartile)}

\item{q3}{numeric vector (third quartile)}
}
\value{
tibble with mean_est and sd_est (NA for rows without required inputs)
}
\description{
This function implements a commonly used approximation for converting median and IQR (q1,q3)
to an estimated mean and sd for meta-analysis when only median and IQR are reported.
The method used here is a simple and conservative approximation:
  mean_est = (q1 + median + q3) / 3
  sd_est   = (q3 - q1) / 1.35
}
\details{
These are heuristic approximations (widely used in applied meta-analyses) and should be
cited in publications. More sophisticated methods (Wan et al. 2014; Luo et al. 2018) exist
and can be implemented later. Use with caution and report that conversion was applied.
